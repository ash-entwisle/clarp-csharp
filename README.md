# Command-Line Arguments Parser

The goal of this project is to provide a simple way to parse command line arguments.
It should parse the arguments in a way that is easy to use and understand
and leave the implementation of commands, subcommands and options/flags to the implementer.

## Installation

TODO

### Usage

```csharp
using LeForg.Clarp.ArgParser;

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        ArgParser p = new();

        Console.WriteLine(p.ToString());
    }
}
```

## Format

```bash
echo \"This is Piped Data\" | command arg1 -flag1 arg2 --option1 "option1 value" -flag2  -- passthrough arguments "are useful"
```

### Arguments

Arguments are the values that are passed to the command,
they are the values that are not preceded by a flag or option
and are not the passthrough arguments.

### Flags

Flags are simple boolean values, they are either present or not.
They are preceded by a single dash `-`.
They are used to indicate the presence of a certain feature or option.
If you want to pass a value to a flag, you should use an [option](#options) instead.

### Options

Options are key-value pairs. They are preceded by two dashes `--`.
They are used to pass a value to a certain feature or option.
If the value contains spaces, it should be enclosed in quotes (`"`/`\`/`'`)
and will end at the next un-escaped quote.
If the value is not enclosed in quotes, it will end at the next space.

### Passthrough Arguments

Passthrough arguments are the values that are passed after a `--`.
They are not processed by the parser
and will be returned as a list of strings for the implementer to use.

### Piped Data

Piped data is the data that is passed to the command through a pipe (`|`).
It is not processed by the parser and stored in `this.pipe`.

## Testing

Running `make test` will test ArgParser with the arguments defined [here](#format).
It should say all tests have passed (you can find the tests in `./example/Program.cs`).
There is a bug where MSTest cant see command line args passed to it, so the tests are run in the example project.
